# A SIMPLE MUSIC SORTING PYTHON SCRIPT

This is a small python script that sorts unsorted mp3 files based on the Artist and the Album.
It Reads the metadata of the mp3 for the artist's and album's name.
# Usage
You will need to install the eyed3 library, you can do it by typing "pip install eyed3" in a terminal.

If you're running Arch/Manjaro you might need to install tk, to do that type "pacman -S tk"

~~Then when you run it, the script will ask for the full path of the directory you want to sort (ex. "C:/Users/user/Music")~~

# NOW YOU CAN JUST CLICK THE DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SORT WITH YOUR MOUSE
